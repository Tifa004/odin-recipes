    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef is delicious on its own - it is a high-quality protein that is tender, juicy, and full of natural flavor. The most important tip for making the perfect burgers is to keep it simple. You don't need a bunch of mix-ins, or you're just masking the flavor of the beef. Remember it's not a meatloaf, but a burger. </p>
    <p>Follow our tips below and you will be known for making the best hamburgers! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sliced cheese (our favorite is thick-sliced, medium cheddar)</li>
        <li>Dill pickle slices</li>   
        <li>Fresh red onions (or caramelized onions) </li>    
        <li>Tomato,</li>   
        <li>Green leaf or iceberg lettuce,</li>    
        <li>Avocado</li> 
        <li>Bacon + pineapple + BBQ sauce</li> 
        <li>Jalapeños to add some heat</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Ground Chuck Beef (80/20) </strong>-grind your own or buy it ground, but 20% fat is ideal and keep it refrigerated until you're ready to use it.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overwork your meat</strong> - this will make it tough and dense.</li>   
        <li><strong>Shape the patties</strong> 1” wider than the bun since they shrink on the grill. </li>    
        <li><strong>Make an indentation</strong> in the center to prevent it from plumping up in the center.</li>   
        <li><strong>Don't Season too early </strong> - Salt changes the structure of proteins and toughens burgers so don't season your ground beef until you have formed your patties and are ready to grill.</li>    
        <li><strong>Get a good Sear </strong>- Once on the grill, let patties brown and sear well (3-5 min) before flipping, and do not press down on the burger save that for making Smash Burgers. </li> 
    </ol>
