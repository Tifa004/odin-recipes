That's all you need for a classic Margherita pizza—the perfect place to start on your journey in home pizza-making—as well as a tried-and-true recipe for when you're looking to serve up something tasty and timeless. </p>
    <p>Our no-frills recipe relies on quality ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, soft mozzarella and fresh basil to really celebrate the beauty of this classic flavor combination. The red, white and green colors may represent the flag of Italy, but this pie is enjoyed all over the world. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 ounces (250 grams) or 12 ounces (330 grams) Classic Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>Flour, for dusting</li>   
        <li>3 ounces (80 grams) crushed tomatoes </li>    
        <li>3 ½ ounces (100 grams) fresh mozzarella, torn into pieces</li>   
        <li>1 teaspoon (5 grams) extra-virgin olive oil</li>    
        <li>Bunch of basil</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fire up your Ooni oven. Aim for 930 ˚F (500 ˚C) on the stone baking board inside. You can check the temperature inside your oven quickly and easily using an infrared thermometer.</li>
        <li>Using a small amount of flour, dust your work surface and your pizza peel.</li>   
        <li>Stretch the pizza dough ball out to 12 or 16 inches (30 or 41 centimeters) and lay it out on your pizza peel. </li>    
        <li>Top with sauce, followed by the mozzarella and olive oil, spreading both evenly on the dough and leaving room for the cornicione, or crust (about a ½ inch or 1 centimeter).</li>   
        <li>Slide the pizza off the peel and into your oven and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, making sure to rotate the pizza every 20 seconds for an even bake.</li>    
        <li>Once cooked, remove the pizza from the oven and top with whole, fresh basil leaves. </li> 
        <li>Slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
